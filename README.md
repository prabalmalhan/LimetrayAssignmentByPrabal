# LimetrayAssignmentByPrabal
This is the demo project which find the tweets have the word 'limetray' using the Twitter Search API and then plots a Graph.


BAD STUFF{Murphy's Law}



Build using Swift 1.2 and Xcode 6.4 (tried to download Xcode 7.3 with MTNL Net but failed everytime)

FEATURES 


1) Implemented Twitter Api 


2) Gets all the tweets with the word 'limetray' ,which were tweeted in the last 7 days.


3) Stores all the tweets Locally using CoreData.



GOOD STUFF


1) No open source library used except for the Graph.


2) Works Without Internet Connection.


3) Uses App only Authentication (Twitter Search Api authentication),thus can fetch much larger pool of results and requests.


4) Built in short time.
